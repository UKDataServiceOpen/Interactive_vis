# Interactive visualisations

**CODE YOUR OWN INTERACTIVE VISUALISATIONS!** 

This repository holds materials for the Interactive Visualisation workshop. 
It contains both **Python code** (written in Jupyter notebook), and **R code** (written in RStudio and converted to .ipynb for purposes of running it in the interactive Binder environment). But if you'd rather clone the repo and execute the code in your own computational environment, please do so, as we also have R code notebooks available as R markdown files. 

**Datasets used** in this workshop are from the **2021 UK census**, and involve the new voluntary question which focuses on **gender identity**. In particular, we explore the relationship between age and gender identity, as well as ethnicity and gender identity.

Each respective code folder contains a **general guide** to creating interactive visualisations (from simple bar charts to scatter plots), and an additional notebook just focused on **interactive mapping**.
