# Interactive_vis
This repository holds materials for the Interactive Visualisation workshop. 
It contains both Python code (written in Jupyter notebook), and R code (written in RStudio and converted to .ipynb for purposes of running it in an interactive environment). But if you'd rather clone the repo and execute the code in your own computational environment, please do so, as we also have R code available as R markdown files. 

Each respective code folder contains a general guide to creating interactive visualisations (from simple bar charts to scatter plots), and an additional notebook just focused on interactive mapping. 

To access and run the code files interactively, click the button below:
